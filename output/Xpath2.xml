        <SPEECH>

            <LINE>Brutus, I do observe you now of late:</LINE>
            <LINE>I have not from your eyes that gentleness</LINE>
            <LINE>And show of love as I was wont to have:</LINE>
            <LINE>You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand</LINE>
            <LINE>Over your friend that loves you.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>Cassius,</LINE>
            <LINE>Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,</LINE>
            <LINE>I turn the trouble of my countenance</LINE>
            <LINE>Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</LINE>
            <LINE>Of late with passions of some difference,</LINE>
            <LINE>Conceptions only proper to myself,</LINE>
            <LINE>Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;</LINE>
            <LINE>But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--</LINE>
            <LINE>Among which number, Cassius, be you one--</LINE>
            <LINE>Nor construe any further my neglect,</LINE>
            <LINE>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,</LINE>
            <LINE>Forgets the shows of love to other men.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;</LINE>
            <LINE>By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried</LINE>
            <LINE>Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.</LINE>
            <LINE>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,</LINE>
            <LINE>But by reflection, by some other things.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>'Tis just:</LINE>
            <LINE>And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</LINE>
            <LINE>That you have no such mirrors as will turn</LINE>
            <LINE>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</LINE>
            <LINE>That you might see your shadow. I have heard,</LINE>
            <LINE>Where many of the best respect in Rome,</LINE>
            <LINE>Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus</LINE>
            <LINE>And groaning underneath this age's yoke,</LINE>
            <LINE>Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,</LINE>
            <LINE>That you would have me seek into myself</LINE>
            <LINE>For that which is not in me?</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:</LINE>
            <LINE>And since you know you cannot see yourself</LINE>
            <LINE>So well as by reflection, I, your glass,</LINE>
            <LINE>Will modestly discover to yourself</LINE>
            <LINE>That of yourself which you yet know not of.</LINE>
            <LINE>And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:</LINE>
            <LINE>Were I a common laugher, or did use</LINE>
            <LINE>To stale with ordinary oaths my love</LINE>
            <LINE>To every new protester; if you know</LINE>
            <LINE>That I do fawn on men and hug them hard</LINE>
            <LINE>And after scandal them, or if you know</LINE>
            <LINE>That I profess myself in banqueting</LINE>
            <LINE>To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <STAGEDIR>Flourish, and shout</STAGEDIR>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>What means this shouting? I do fear, the people</LINE>
            <LINE>Choose Caesar for their king.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>Ay, do you fear it?</LINE>
            <LINE>Then must I think you would not have it so.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.</LINE>
            <LINE>But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</LINE>
            <LINE>What is it that you would impart to me?</LINE>
            <LINE>If it be aught toward the general good,</LINE>
            <LINE>Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,</LINE>
            <LINE>And I will look on both indifferently,</LINE>
            <LINE>For let the gods so speed me as I love</LINE>
            <LINE>The name of honour more than I fear death.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</LINE>
            <LINE>As well as I do know your outward favour.</LINE>
            <LINE>Well, honour is the subject of my story.</LINE>
            <LINE>I cannot tell what you and other men</LINE>
            <LINE>Think of this life; but, for my single self,</LINE>
            <LINE>I had as lief not be as live to be</LINE>
            <LINE>In awe of such a thing as I myself.</LINE>
            <LINE>I was born free as Caesar; so were you:</LINE>
            <LINE>We both have fed as well, and we can both</LINE>
            <LINE>Endure the winter's cold as well as he:</LINE>
            <LINE>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</LINE>
            <LINE>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</LINE>
            <LINE>Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now</LINE>
            <LINE>Leap in with me into this angry flood,</LINE>
            <LINE>And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,</LINE>
            <LINE>Accoutred as I was, I plunged in</LINE>
            <LINE>And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</LINE>
            <LINE>The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it</LINE>
            <LINE>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</LINE>
            <LINE>And stemming it with hearts of controversy;</LINE>
            <LINE>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</LINE>
            <LINE>Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'</LINE>
            <LINE>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</LINE>
            <LINE>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</LINE>
            <LINE>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</LINE>
            <LINE>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</LINE>
            <LINE>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</LINE>
            <LINE>A wretched creature and must bend his body,</LINE>
            <LINE>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</LINE>
            <LINE>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</LINE>
            <LINE>And when the fit was on him, I did mark</LINE>
            <LINE>How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;</LINE>
            <LINE>His coward lips did from their colour fly,</LINE>
            <LINE>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</LINE>
            <LINE>Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</LINE>
            <LINE>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</LINE>
            <LINE>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</LINE>
            <LINE>Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'</LINE>
            <LINE>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</LINE>
            <LINE>A man of such a feeble temper should</LINE>
            <LINE>So get the start of the majestic world</LINE>
            <LINE>And bear the palm alone.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <STAGEDIR>Shout. Flourish</STAGEDIR>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>Another general shout!</LINE>
            <LINE>I do believe that these applauses are</LINE>
            <LINE>For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</LINE>
            <LINE>Like a Colossus, and we petty men</LINE>
            <LINE>Walk under his huge legs and peep about</LINE>
            <LINE>To find ourselves dishonourable graves.</LINE>
            <LINE>Men at some time are masters of their fates:</LINE>
            <LINE>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</LINE>
            <LINE>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</LINE>
            <LINE>Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?</LINE>
            <LINE>Why should that name be sounded more than yours?</LINE>
            <LINE>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</LINE>
            <LINE>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</LINE>
            <LINE>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,</LINE>
            <LINE>Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.</LINE>
            <LINE>Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</LINE>
            <LINE>Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,</LINE>
            <LINE>That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!</LINE>
            <LINE>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</LINE>
            <LINE>When went there by an age, since the great flood,</LINE>
            <LINE>But it was famed with more than with one man?</LINE>
            <LINE>When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,</LINE>
            <LINE>That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?</LINE>
            <LINE>Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,</LINE>
            <LINE>When there is in it but one only man.</LINE>
            <LINE>O, you and I have heard our fathers say,</LINE>
            <LINE>There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd</LINE>
            <LINE>The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome</LINE>
            <LINE>As easily as a king.</LINE>
        </SPEECH>
        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;</LINE>
            <LINE>What you would work me to, I have some aim:</LINE>
            <LINE>How I have thought of this and of these times,</LINE>
            <LINE>I shall recount hereafter; for this present,</LINE>
            <LINE>I would not, so with love I might entreat you,</LINE>
            <LINE>Be any further moved. What you have said</LINE>
            <LINE>I will consider; what you have to say</LINE>
            <LINE>I will with patience hear, and find a time</LINE>
            <LINE>Both meet to hear and answer such high things.</LINE>
            <LINE>Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:</LINE>
            <LINE>Brutus had rather be a villager</LINE>
            <LINE>Than to repute himself a son of Rome</LINE>
            <LINE>Under these hard conditions as this time</LINE>
            <LINE>Is like to lay upon us.</LINE>

            <LINE>I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:</LINE>
            <LINE>it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark</LINE>
            <LINE>Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown</LINE>
            <LINE>neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told</LINE>
            <LINE>you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my</LINE>
            <LINE>thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he</LINE>
            <LINE>offered it to him again; then he put it by again:</LINE>
            <LINE>but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his</LINE>
            <LINE>fingers off it. And then he offered it the third</LINE>
            <LINE>time; he put it the third time by: and still as he</LINE>
            <LINE>refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their</LINE>
            <LINE>chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps</LINE>
            <LINE>and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because</LINE>
            <LINE>Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked</LINE>
            <LINE>Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and</LINE>
            <LINE>for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of</LINE>

            <LINE>I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,</LINE>
            <LINE>Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not</LINE>
            <LINE>clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and</LINE>
            <LINE>displeased them, as they use to do the players in</LINE>

        <SPEECH>
            <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
            <LINE>Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the</LINE>
            <LINE>common herd was glad he refused the crown, he</LINE>
            <LINE>plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his</LINE>
            <LINE>throat to cut. An I had been a man of any</LINE>
            <LINE>occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,</LINE>
            <LINE>I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so</LINE>
            <LINE>he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,</LINE>
            <LINE>If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired</LINE>
            <LINE>their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three</LINE>
            <LINE>or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good</LINE>
            <LINE>soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but</LINE>
            <LINE>there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had</LINE>
            <LINE>stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.</LINE>
