                <LINE>Octavius, I have seen more days than you:</LINE>
                <LINE>And though we lay these honours on this man,</LINE>
                <LINE>To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,</LINE>
                <LINE>He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,</LINE>
                <LINE>To groan and sweat under the business,</LINE>
                <LINE>Either led or driven, as we point the way;</LINE>
                <LINE>And having brought our treasure where we will,</LINE>
                <LINE>Then take we down his load, and turn him off,</LINE>
                <LINE>Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,</LINE>

                <LINE>So is my horse, Octavius; and for that</LINE>
                <LINE>I do appoint him store of provender:</LINE>
                <LINE>It is a creature that I teach to fight,</LINE>
                <LINE>To wind, to stop, to run directly on,</LINE>
                <LINE>His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.</LINE>
                <LINE>And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;</LINE>
                <LINE>He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;</LINE>
                <LINE>A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds</LINE>
                <LINE>On abjects, orts and imitations,</LINE>
                <LINE>Which, out of use and staled by other men,</LINE>
                <LINE>Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,</LINE>
                <LINE>But as a property. And now, Octavius,</LINE>
                <LINE>Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius</LINE>
                <LINE>Are levying powers: we must straight make head:</LINE>
                <LINE>Therefore let our alliance be combined,</LINE>
                <LINE>Our best friends made, our means stretch'd</LINE>
