                <LINE>Upon a labouring day without the sign</LINE>

                <LINE>meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's</LINE>
                <LINE>matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon</LINE>
                <LINE>to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I</LINE>
                <LINE>recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon</LINE>

                <LINE>into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,</LINE>
                <LINE>to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.</LINE>

                <LINE>What tributaries follow him to Rome,</LINE>
                <LINE>To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?</LINE>
                <LINE>You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!</LINE>
                <LINE>O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,</LINE>
                <LINE>Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft</LINE>
                <LINE>Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,</LINE>
                <LINE>To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,</LINE>
                <LINE>Your infants in your arms, and there have sat</LINE>
                <LINE>The livelong day, with patient expectation,</LINE>
                <LINE>To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:</LINE>
                <LINE>And when you saw his chariot but appear,</LINE>
                <LINE>Have you not made an universal shout,</LINE>
                <LINE>That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,</LINE>
                <LINE>To hear the replication of your sounds</LINE>
                <LINE>Made in her concave shores?</LINE>
                <LINE>And do you now put on your best attire?</LINE>
                <LINE>And do you now cull out a holiday?</LINE>
                <LINE>And do you now strew flowers in his way</LINE>
                <LINE>That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!</LINE>
                <LINE>Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,</LINE>

                <LINE>Assemble all the poor men of your sort;</LINE>
                <LINE>Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears</LINE>
                <LINE>Into the channel, till the lowest stream</LINE>
                <LINE>Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.</LINE>

                <LINE>See whether their basest metal be not moved;</LINE>
                <LINE>They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.</LINE>
                <LINE>Go you down that way towards the Capitol;</LINE>
                <LINE>This way will I disrobe the images,</LINE>

                <LINE>It is no matter; let no images</LINE>
                <LINE>Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,</LINE>
                <LINE>And drive away the vulgar from the streets:</LINE>
                <LINE>So do you too, where you perceive them thick.</LINE>
                <LINE>These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing</LINE>
                <LINE>Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,</LINE>
                <LINE>Who else would soar above the view of men</LINE>
                <LINE>And keep us all in servile fearfulness.</LINE>

                <LINE>Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,</LINE>
                <LINE>I turn the trouble of my countenance</LINE>
                <LINE>Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</LINE>
                <LINE>Of late with passions of some difference,</LINE>
                <LINE>Conceptions only proper to myself,</LINE>
                <LINE>Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;</LINE>
                <LINE>But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--</LINE>
                <LINE>Among which number, Cassius, be you one--</LINE>
                <LINE>Nor construe any further my neglect,</LINE>
                <LINE>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,</LINE>

            <SPEECH>
                <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
                <LINE>Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;</LINE>
                <LINE>By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried</LINE>
                <LINE>Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.</LINE>
                <LINE>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</LINE>

                <LINE>No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,</LINE>
                <LINE>But by reflection, by some other things.</LINE>
            </SPEECH>
            <SPEECH>
                <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
                <LINE>'Tis just:</LINE>
                <LINE>And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</LINE>
                <LINE>That you have no such mirrors as will turn</LINE>
                <LINE>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</LINE>
                <LINE>That you might see your shadow. I have heard,</LINE>
                <LINE>Where many of the best respect in Rome,</LINE>
                <LINE>Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus</LINE>
                <LINE>And groaning underneath this age's yoke,</LINE>
                <LINE>Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.</LINE>
            </SPEECH>
            <SPEECH>
                <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
                <LINE>Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,</LINE>
                <LINE>That you would have me seek into myself</LINE>
                <LINE>For that which is not in me?</LINE>
            </SPEECH>
            <SPEECH>
                <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
                <LINE>Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:</LINE>
                <LINE>And since you know you cannot see yourself</LINE>
                <LINE>So well as by reflection, I, your glass,</LINE>

                <LINE>I had as lief not be as live to be</LINE>
                <LINE>In awe of such a thing as I myself.</LINE>
                <LINE>I was born free as Caesar; so were you:</LINE>
                <LINE>We both have fed as well, and we can both</LINE>
                <LINE>Endure the winter's cold as well as he:</LINE>
                <LINE>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</LINE>
                <LINE>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</LINE>
                <LINE>Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now</LINE>
                <LINE>Leap in with me into this angry flood,</LINE>
                <LINE>And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,</LINE>
                <LINE>Accoutred as I was, I plunged in</LINE>
                <LINE>And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</LINE>
                <LINE>The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it</LINE>
                <LINE>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</LINE>
                <LINE>And stemming it with hearts of controversy;</LINE>
                <LINE>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</LINE>
                <LINE>Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'</LINE>
                <LINE>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</LINE>
                <LINE>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</LINE>
                <LINE>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</LINE>
                <LINE>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</LINE>
                <LINE>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</LINE>
                <LINE>A wretched creature and must bend his body,</LINE>
                <LINE>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</LINE>
                <LINE>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</LINE>
                <LINE>And when the fit was on him, I did mark</LINE>

                <LINE>His coward lips did from their colour fly,</LINE>
                <LINE>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</LINE>
                <LINE>Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</LINE>

                <LINE>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</LINE>
                <LINE>Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'</LINE>

                <LINE>Men at some time are masters of their fates:</LINE>
                <LINE>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</LINE>

                <LINE>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</LINE>
                <LINE>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</LINE>
                <LINE>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,</LINE>

                <LINE>When went there by an age, since the great flood,</LINE>

                <LINE>When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,</LINE>

                <LINE>Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,</LINE>

                <LINE>O, you and I have heard our fathers say,</LINE>
                <LINE>There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd</LINE>

                <LINE>Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:</LINE>
